get_ipython().set_next_input('Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'iteration')
Ans: __iter__ and __next__ are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.

__iter__ returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.
__next__ is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value. Also Stopiteration is raised when there is no value to return.

        return self
    def __next__(self):
        if self.current > self.high:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            self.current += 1
            return self.current - 1
for ele in Counter(5,15):
    print(ele, end=" ")

get_ipython().set_next_input('Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'printing')
Ans: __str__ and __repr__ are two operator overloading methods that manage printing.

In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous and __str__ is to be readable.
Whenever we are printing any object reference internally __str__ method will be called by default.
The main purpose of __str__ is for readability. it prints the informal string representation of an object, one that is useful for printing the object. it may not be possible to convert result string to original object.
__repr__ is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development.

    def __init__(self,name,roll_no):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        
s1 = Student("Mano",1)
print(str(s1))

class Student:
    def __init__(self,name,roll_no):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
    def __str__(self):
        return f'Student Name: {self.name} and Roll No: {self.roll_no}'
    
s1 = Student("Mano",1)
print(str(s1))

import datetime
today = datetime.datetime.now()

s = str(today) # converting datetime object to presentable str
print(s)
try: d = eval(s) # converting str back to datetime object
except: print("Unable to convert back to original object")
    
u = repr(today) # converting datetime object to str
print(u)
e = eval(u) # converting str back to datetime object
print(e)

get_ipython().set_next_input('Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'operations')
Ans: In a class use of slice() in __getitem__ method is used for intercept slice operation. This slice method is provided with start integer number, stop integer number and step integer number.

Example: __getitem__(slice(start,stop,step))

get_ipython().set_next_input('Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'addition')
Ans: a+b is normal addition. Whereas a+=b is inplace addition operation. In this in-place addition a itself will store the value of addition. In a class __iadd__ method is used for this in-place operation

class Book:
    def __init__(self,pages):
        self.pages = pages
    def __iadd__(self,other):
        self.pages += other.pages
        return self.pages
        
b1 = Book(100)
b2 = Book(200)
b1+=b2
print(b1)

get_ipython().set_next_input('Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'overloading')
Ans: Operator overloading is used when we want to use an operator other than its normal operation to have different meaning according to the context required in user defined function.


# In[5]:


class Book:
    def __init__(self,pages):
        self.pages = pages
    def __add__(self,other):
        return self.pages+other.pages
b1 = Book(100)
b2 = Book(200)
print(f'Total Number of Pages -> {b1+b2}')
